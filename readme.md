I wrote the code to participate in the kaggle competition ["LLM - Detect AI Generated Text"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/overview).

This competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.

Here are some steps to get started:
1. Open 4.0.py
2. Install all the dependencies required
3. Change the path of each dataset
4. Run the code
5. You'll get accuracy and submission.csv 

Good luck!
